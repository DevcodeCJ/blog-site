# Project: Blog App

**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹

A basic NodeJS blog app, set up with the bare minimum functionality to display blogs, add blogs and delete exiting blogs from a MongoDB backend. It's currently run on localhost, listening on port 3000.

- ðŸ‘‰ Now hosted on Heroku. Visit the link [here](https://blogbase-app.herokuapp.com/blogs)

## Building the project

The workflow for this project focused majorly on the tools below:

1. Node JS

2. Mongo DB and Mongoose

3. Express and EJS

4. MVC

5. Routing

Users can view, add and delete blog data dynamically to and from the mongo database. The app is mostly built to run in the back end with a few frontend functionalities like deleting existing blogs.
